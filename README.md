## Current Status: Repository Under Construction :construction:

Thank you for your interest in PerceptGuide! This repository is currently being prepared for public release following the peer-review process of our manuscript submitted to *Medical Image Analysis*.

We are committed to ensuring full reproducibility and facilitating further research based on our work.

## Planned Content:

Upon acceptance and publication of the manuscript, this repository will include:

1.  **Source Code:**
    *   The complete Python code (using PyTorch) for the PerceptGuide framework.
    *   Scripts for training the model on the M²-US dataset.

2.  **Pre-trained Models:**
    *   Weights for the final PerceptGuide model trained on M²-US.

3.  **M²-US Dataset Resources:**
    *   Detailed instructions on how to construct the M²-US dataset, which is compiled from 13 distinct publicly available ultrasound datasets.
    *   **Access Information:** For each source dataset:
        *   Links to official download pages or application procedures where applicable.
        *   Direct provision of pre-processed data *only* for source datasets whose licenses explicitly permit redistribution.
    *   **Preprocessing Scripts:** The exact scripts used to process the original source datasets into the unified format required by our training code. This ensures others can replicate the M²-US dataset accurately.
4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Clear instructions on setting up the environment, preparing the data, running the code, and understanding the framework components.

5.  **Detailed Ablation Results:**
    *   Comprehensive tables showing the per-dataset performance breakdown for the component-wise prompt ablation study presented in the paper (Summary in Table 6). Provided in formats like `.csv` or `.md`.
